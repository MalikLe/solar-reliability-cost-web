# Estimating the Cost of Electricity and Reliability for Decentralized Solar Power Systems in sub-Saharan Africa

This is the code for the web-based tool found at [https://emac.berkeley.edu/reliability](https://emac.berkeley.edu/reliability). It allows you to explore the cost of decentralized solar power systems for increasing energy access in sub-Saharan Africa, and accompanies the research published in [Nature Energy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-018-0240-y). If you're using components of the actual analysis tool, and not just looking at this for a code reference, please cite this repository and the research:

## Technical details
This app is built on Dash in Python 3, and is still a beta version under development. Dash is great! Check out their [product page](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) and their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/plotly/dash)!
